            <locationDescription>The cryptid was first seen near the old power plant next to the National Guard armory buildings.  It followed the observers along Route 62, past the armory, all the way to the C.C. Lewis farm.</locationDescription>

        <descriptionOfAccount>The four observers were in Scarberry's car at the time they saw the cryptid.  It was near the old power plant.  They describe it as being able to stand on two legs, and flying very quickly (over 100 MPH), but running clumsily.  The cryptid followed them along route 62, past the armory, through downtown.  The cryptid's eyes glowed red when their car lights shone on them, and it seemed to be afraid of the light.  At the C.C. Lewis farm, they heard the sound of wings flapping, and the cryptid rose straight up, and was gone.</descriptionOfAccount>
