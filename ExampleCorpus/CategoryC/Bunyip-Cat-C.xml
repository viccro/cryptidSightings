        <mediaDescription>A reporter describing their impressions of the wildlife drawings of the bunyip by an artist named Mr. Stocqueler. The artist is likely Edwin Roper Loftus Stocqueler. He saw at least 6 bunyips over hundreds of miles of and down the Murray and Gouldburn rivers. The drawings were made as part of a commision from England to collect sketches of the Gold-fields and Australian scenery for the United Service Gazette. Note that Stocqueler is variably spelled Stocqueler throughout the article.</mediaDescription>

            <cryptidDescription>Quoted text: 
                "the Bunyip is a large freshwater seal, 
                having two small paddles or fins attached 
                to the shoulders, a long swan like neck, 
                a head like a dog, and a curious bag hanging 
                under the jaw, resembling the pouch 
                of the pelican. The animal is covered with 
                hair, like the platypus, and the colour is a 
                glossy black."

            <locationDescription>At least 6 bunyips were sighted up and down the Murray and Goulburn rivers in Australia before stopping in Albany, Australia, where the author of the article first saw the sketches of the bunyips drawn by Mr. Stocqueler.</locationDescription>

        <descriptionOfAccount>One account was noted in the article. Quoted text: 
            "Mr. Stocqueler saw no less 
            than six of these curious animals at different 
            times; his boat was within thirty feet 
            of one near M'Guire's punt on the Goulburn,
            and he fired at the Bunyip, but did 
            not succeed in capturing him. The smallest 
            appeared to be about five feet in length, 
            and the largest exceeded fifteen feet. The 
            head of the largest was the size of a bullock's 
            head, and three feet out of water."
