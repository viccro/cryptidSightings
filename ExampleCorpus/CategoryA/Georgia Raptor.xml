            Philips and his grandfather were hunting on his grandfather's land
            when they heard an unusual, unidentifieable noise.  Investigating, they saw a creature walk
            out approximately 150 in front of them that "looked just like a raptor from the popular
            Jurassic Park movies."  It was bipedal, with a long tail and short arms, and had large claws on
            its feet and hands.  Philips stated it to be about 5 feet tall, at the shoulders.  Philips
            and his grandfather stayed still, and waited for the creature to pass.  It sniffed the air
            then ran into the bushes Once they felt safe, Philips and his grandfather returned to the truck and left.
