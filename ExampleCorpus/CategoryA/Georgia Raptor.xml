        <descriptionOfAccount>Philips and his grandfather were hunting on his grandfather's land
            when they heard an unusual, unidentifieable noise.  Investigating, they saw a creature walk
            out approximately 150 in front of them that "looked just like a raptor from the popular
            Jurassic Park movies."  Philips and his grandfather stayed still, and waited for the creature to pass. 
            It sniffed the air, then ran into the bushes.  Once they felt safe,
            Philips and his grandfather returned to the truck and left.</descriptionOfAccount>
