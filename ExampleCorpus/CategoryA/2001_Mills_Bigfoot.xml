            <mediaDescription>A video taken by John Mills during the Campus Life youth retreat. The video starts by exploring the lair of "some kinda creature", with a structured shelter of branches and debris "snapped by mighty mighty strength", with claw marks on surrounding trees. As the group explores the area, someone shouts out "He's walking down. Bigfoot's walking down right now," referring to a ridge in the distance. The camera zooms in to the figure on the ridge, watching him descend to a cluster of trees. When he gets to the trees, the figure begins pacing back and forth, before continuing his descent.
            The video remained underground until Jim Mills' death in the summer of 2011.</mediaDescription>
