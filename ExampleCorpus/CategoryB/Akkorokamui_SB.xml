        <descriptionOfReport>John Batchelor, an English missionary, studied the Ainu people of Japan and published works describing his impression of their culture. One of his accounts is credited as being one of the earliest accounts in English of the Akkorokamui. Quoted text, page 530: 
            "After inspecting the boats we returned to our 
            inn, fully expecting to hold our meeting the next 
            day. But we were doomed to disappointment once 
            again. On inquiring about the matter in the morn- 
            ing we found the whole village under a cloud. 
            Three men, it was said, were out trying to catch 
            a sword-fish, when all at once a great sea-monster, 
            with large staring eyes, appeared in front of them 
            and proceeded to attack the boat. A desperate 
            fight ensued. The monster was round in shape, 
            and emitted a dark fluid which had a very powerful 
            and noxious odour.* The three men fled in dismay, 
            not so much indeed for fear, they say, but on 
            account of the dreadful smell. However that may 
            have been, they were so scared that the next morn- 
            ing all three refused to get up and eat ; they were 
            lying in their beds pale and trembling.
            
            *The men say it was a devil; and I am inclined to think from the description that it was really a 'devil-fish' or an octopus."
